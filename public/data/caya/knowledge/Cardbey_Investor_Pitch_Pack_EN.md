# Cardbey Investor Pitch Pack (English)

## Executive Summary

Cardbey is an AI-powered platform that automatically creates, operates, and scales businesses. This is a rare, time-limited opportunity to invest early in a pre-scale phase company before valuation multiples rise. The seed round is capped at AUD 3 million.

## The Idea

Cardbey builds 24/7 AI-driven businesses that sell anywhere, anytime. Investors are not just funding a startup — they are owning a share of an AI machine that never sleeps.

## The Problem

Millions of people dream of starting an online business but face major barriers: it’s too complex, too costly, and too slow. Small businesses lack digital know-how and struggle with marketing, sales, and logistics — especially in adopting AI to compete.

## The Solution: Cardbey

Cardbey solves these challenges through four seamlessly integrated, AI-powered modules: Cardbey Platform (social commerce), C-Net Smart Display (AI ad & sales device), Smart Logistics (automated ordering & delivery), and AIcoin (future financial engine). Together they form a self-operating business ecosystem powered by AI.

## Market Opportunity

The global markets for e-commerce, digital advertising, and logistics are worth trillions of dollars. Cardbey begins in Southeast Asia (Years 1–3) and expands globally thereafter. Large market + network effects = exponential growth potential.

## Business Model

Revenue streams include premium software subscriptions, C-Net advertising fees, e-commerce transaction commissions, smart logistics margins, and credit/AIcoin circulation.

## Traction

Core platform completed; C-Net Smart Displays deployed; packaging and fulfillment division launched; pilot programs active in Vietnam and Australia.

## Roadmap

Years 1–3: Deploy platform in Vietnam and Australia, expand to Southeast Asia. Years 4–5: Scale globally and target IPO.

## Competitive Advantage

Cardbey pioneers the convergence of social networks, e-commerce, and physical AI-powered ad & sales devices. Its AI brain enables scalable growth without proportional cost. Barriers: integrated hardware, software, and network.
