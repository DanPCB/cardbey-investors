## 1. Overview — What Cardbey Is and Why It Matters
Cardbey helps anyone — from small shop owners to new entrepreneurs — turn their ideas, menus, or products into live digital stores in minutes.

Using AI + OCR, Cardbey can scan a photo of a product list, flyer, or menu, understand it, and automatically create a working online store — complete with categories, pricing, and layout.

But Cardbey doesn’t stop there. It also helps the store market itself through an AI-powered Marketing Dashboard, distribute content to C-Net smart screens, and reward activity with CAI Credits — the digital points system that connects the whole ecosystem.

**In short:** Cardbey is an AI business engine that helps people create, promote, and grow their own digital business — automatically.

## 2. Business Development Playbook
This is the standard flow Cardbey follows for every new business or store:

### Step 1 — Onboarding a Store
The user uploads or scans their product/menu sheet.
→ Cardbey’s OCR + AI reads and structures it into categories, images, and prices.

### Step 2 — AI Store Creation
In less than 60 seconds, Cardbey builds a live online store — multilingual, mobile-ready, and shareable via QR or link.

### Step 3 — Marketing Dashboard
Once the store is live, the owner accesses the Marketing Dashboard, where the AI suggests posts, ad campaigns, and marketing materials automatically.
→ See also: Caya Performer (coming phase) for deeper automation.

### Step 4 — C-Net Integration
With one click, campaigns can appear on Cardbey’s C-Net display network — digital screens on FireTVs, kiosks, or shop displays — connecting the online store to the physical world.

### Step 5 — CAI Credits
Every action (upload, sale, ad display) earns CAI Credits, Cardbey’s internal digital currency.
These credits can pay for ads, upgrades, or be redeemed for future benefits.
